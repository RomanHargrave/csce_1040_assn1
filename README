Roman Hargrave, ***REMOVED***; 

GradeBook.

Compiler flags: -std=c99 -lm -D_USE_GNU_SOURCE

Optionally, define -D__USE_POSIX 


This project is incomplete.
I have been working on it since around monday the week of 2015-02-09.
This is due to my being added to the class late (placement test).

the artifact ./gradebook provides help.

Run ./test_serialize and the ./gradebook dump <name of the file, *.gb, output by the test> 
in order to see the current progress.

All that is left is to implement the user interface.
