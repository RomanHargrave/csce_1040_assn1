CSCE 1040 2015 : Homework 1
===========================

This is the gradebook assignment from computer science 1040.
It is fully functional, but is not entirely to spec with the assignment requirements due to a fiasco.

There are three branches:

* master - working branch
* dynamic - linkedlist implemented, code not yet refactored to use it
* instance-broker - linkedlist re-implemented using an instance broker and C hacks to emulate private fields, debugging in progress
